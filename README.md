Little Lemon Restaurant - Booking and Menu Management System
Project Overview:

This project is a web-based application designed for Little Lemon Restaurant, focusing on enhancing customer experience through online table reservations and menu management. It aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly interface for customers to book tables and view the restaurant's menu, while also offering administrative tools for restaurant staff to manage bookings and update menu items.

Key Features:

Table Reservation System:
Users can select a date, time, number of guests, and occasion to reserve a table.
Real-time availability updates are managed using API calls.
Client-side form validation ensures accurate input and improves user experience.
Confirmation of successful bookings.

Menu Display:
A dynamic and visually appealing display of the restaurant's menu items.
Categorized menu sections for easy navigation (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts).
Ability to add and remove menu items via an admin panel.

API Integration:
Utilizes a mock API for handling booking requests and menu data.
Asynchronous data fetching for efficient loading and updates.
User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI):
Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.
Accessible design principles are implemented for inclusivity.
Clear and intuitive navigation.

Unit Testing:
Comprehensive unit tests are implemented to ensure the reliability and stability of the application's core functionalities, including form validation and API interactions.


Technologies Used:

Frontend:
React.js: For building the dynamic and interactive user interface, utilizing components for reusability and maintainability.
React Testing Library: For unit testing React components, ensuring reliability and accuracy.
React Datepicker: For the date picker functionality, providing a user-friendly date selection interface.
React Router: For managing navigation and routing within the application, creating a smooth user experience.
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript: For the core structure, styling, and interactivity of the web application.
React State Management: Using useState and potentially useReducer hooks for managing component states and data flow.
Backend (Mock):
JavaScript (Node.js - can be used to create the mock api): For simulating API endpoints and data handling, enabling frontend development without a live backend.
Version Control:
Git: For managing code changes, collaboration, and version tracking.
